F.A.Q. Web Page Design
Project Overview
This project is a responsive F.A.Q. (Frequently Asked Questions) page based on the provided Figma layout. The design focuses on a minimalistic and clean layout, ensuring compatibility with both desktop and mobile views. The page is designed to adapt seamlessly, providing a great user experience across different screen sizes.

Key Features
The web page features a responsive design that switches to a mobile-friendly layout when the screen width is 480px or less. Content is centered on the page with a maximum width of 1000px, providing both readability and visual appeal. Interactive elements such as links and buttons have hover and active states for an improved user experience.

Design Specifications
The project uses two main fonts: Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT. If these fonts are not available on your computer, you can download them online. The color scheme includes a hover/active state for links in a light red shade, defined as #FF6565. For buttons, a hover/active state of slight transparency is applied with an opacity value of 0.9. The layout of the page maintains a maximum width of 1000px, centered for visual balance. When the screen width reduces to 480px or below, the page automatically switches to the mobile version.

Interactions
The web page adapts to smaller screen sizes when the width is 480px or less, ensuring that mobile users experience an optimized version of the site. Links change color to a light red (#FF6565) when hovered or clicked, while buttons become slightly transparent on hover or active states, providing an interactive experience for the user.

How to Run
To view the page, clone the repository using the command: git clone https://github.com/your-username/faq-page.git. Once cloned, open the index.html file in any web browser. The page will automatically adjust depending on the screen size, showcasing both the desktop and mobile versions.
